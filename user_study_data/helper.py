# User study 1 plan:
# Preferably start on Sept - Oct , aiming 30 participants (Deaf or HoH).
# Participants will be recruited by online -> mechanical turk? or simple online link distribution.
# 
# The purpose is to look at the acceptable thresholds to errors in CC
# Collecting 
# 1. Whether they detected the error or not           -> Yes/No buttons
# 2. The confidence level on the decision in step 1.  -> 3? or 5? levels
# 3. Quality ratings of CC                            -> 5-point Likert Scale?

# Videos with error variations
# Delay variations                                 # Speed of CC presentation variations
# 1. No delay error (same as transcript)           # 1. No speed error (WPM at ideal speed)
# 2. 
# 3. 
# 4. 
# 5. 

# Number of missing words (tf-idf/ranking for rarity)
# 1. 0% no errors                  
# 2. Missing 1% unimportant words
# 3. Missing 2% unimportant words
# 4. Missing 1% important words
# 5. Missing 2% important words

# Paraphrased/Edited caption detection
# 1. Edited
# 2. Not edited
