00:00:53:09	00:00:54:08	00:00:00:29	Yeah, probably
00:00:54:08	00:00:55:13	00:00:01:05	Corey Perry's penalty because
00:00:55:13	00:00:57:03	00:00:01:20	they'll saw off Kesler and
00:00:57:03	00:00:59:02	00:00:01:29	Scheifele, the original
00:00:59:02	00:01:01:18	00:00:02:14	combatants, and then, as you
00:01:01:18	00:01:02:29	00:00:01:11	mentioned, it was Corey
00:01:02:29	00:01:04:01	00:00:01:02	Perry that came in and grabbed
00:01:04:01	00:01:06:28	00:00:02:27	Blake Wheeler.
