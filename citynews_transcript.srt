1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,270
lots of Santa Claus parades going on.
Grey cup is going on and as you just

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:07,539
heard in sports it is snowing in Ottawa.
it's about two to five centimeters this

3
00:00:07,539 --> 00:00:11,440
is a very small area of low pressure
that is sinking across southeastern

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,040
Ontario. the darker the blue the more
intense the snow and there into the most

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,430
intense part right now in Ottawa. it's
only going to taper off from this point

6
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,000
forward and again it's about two to four
maybe up to five centimeters of snow the

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,960
back end of it though is also bringing
some flurries across Lake Simcoe. some of

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,380
these flurries just starting to edge
down into northern York Region over the
next hour or two. So areas like 

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,910
Whitchurch-Stouffville into possibly as far
south as Unionville, Markham and northern

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,820
Ajax and Whitby you may see a few
scattered flurries before this evening

11
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,559
is out. Otherwise we are not expecting
any accumulation. By the way future casts,

12
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,280
nothing. i got nothing. i got a little bit
of cloud to show you and that's it. in

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,420
fact over the next three days we are
starting a dry stretch. Fairly sunny

14
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,809
stretch with just a few clouds here and
there. that's gonna be Monday Tuesday and
Wednesday as well current temperatures

15
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,899
are just slightly above that freezing
mark. we've got a wind chill though feels

16
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,830
like of about minus 2 to minus 5 out there. so
yeah slight wind chill and you'll have

17
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:09,670
to dress for that in the morning. we've
got wind gusts right now very near to

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,420
40 km/h a little bit stronger down at the
island because the wind is pushing out

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,350
over the lake. less friction so it tends
to be a little bit stronger and as we go
through the day tomorrow. I meant to put

20
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:22,090
a pause in there and slow that down for
you but we are looking at gusty

21
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,240
conditions tonight. starting to ease
through the day tomorrow so we don't
have much of a windchill to deal with.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,300
just in the morning it will feel like
about minus 6 tomorrow close to seasonal
temperatures. there is your sunny dry

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,800
stretch. we'll have gusty winds on
Tuesday that's coming in out of the

24
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,470
southwest and that is a 14 that you are
seeing. the average sorry the record high

25
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,800
for that day is just over 18. so it's not
gonna be record-breaking but will it be

26
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,500
into some evening rain Thursday and
Friday's the day you got to bring the

27
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,830
umbrella. this my friends the first
weekend of December. we'll start off with

28
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:54,930
a few showers bit end off fairly sunny.
