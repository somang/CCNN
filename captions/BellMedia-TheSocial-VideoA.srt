about the show is released big question

25
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,990
that a lot of people are pondering this

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,299
weekend as well should real live animals

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,030
appear in film and television or is

28
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,310
computer-generated imagery or CGI the

29
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,830
better option according to TMZ animal

30
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,960
rights activists animal rights activists

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,840
that is will be picketing movie theaters

32
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,790
over the film a dogs purpose recently a

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,860
video surfaced of what appears to be a

34
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,509
frightened German Shepherd being forced

35
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,189
into a pool of rushing water during the

36
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,710
filming of the movie the production

37
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,119
company told TMZ that they did not force

38
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,280
the dog to go through with the stunt

39
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,009
instead they called a break and filmed

40
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,659
it once the dog calmed down and was ok

41
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,270
with it so this is a big controversy

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,009
because it's affecting the film now as

43
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,259
the actress on the panel what's your

44
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,840
take on this it's interesting the CGI

45
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,970
option because I shot a film last summer

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,409
and we had to we had to sing with a bear

47
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,689
I was supposed to scare us and the

48
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,750
director met with various trainers and

49
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,299
in the end he he didn't trust them quite

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,890
enough so basically it was CGI but I

51
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,750
feel like sometimes it is true that on

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:08,729
set there's that feeling of because

53
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,700
we're filming fiction we can push the

54
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,960
limits and it's it's as if we weren't

55
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,850
shooting reality

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,770
and me as a child actor I mean we're

57
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,060
talking about animals right now but to

58
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,170
me it's the same thing with child actors

59
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,220
I've seen and I've experienced moments

60
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,220
[Applause]
