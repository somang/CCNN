1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,170

Iran owes rookies have a hundred and

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,080
seventy five points so far this year

8
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,660
that is the most in the NHL welcome to

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,020
Sports Center everyone Kate alongside

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,519
Natasha

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,810
so unfortunate for the flames I mean

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,449
they looked like they had a little bit

13
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,310
of momentum as of late and now they just

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,410
looked like they're reeling once again

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,840
on the flip side though Toronto snapping

16
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,370
their mini slide and good for them to

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,540
pick up a monster win at home because we

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,950
know they're great on the road but they

19
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,600
have struggled at times of the Air

20
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,250
Canada center yeah they looks really

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,050
good on Monday and like you mentioned

22
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,239
Calgary all of a sudden really new 7 to

23
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,460
3 to the Oilers on Saturday and then get

24
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,750
shutout a game later so not much going

25
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,250
right for them lately with much more on

26
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,520
this one here is Glen Schuyler on the

27
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:55,320
panel thank you very much alongside Dave

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,969
Poole and Jeff O'Neal and Bob McKenzie

29
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,530
well much like his team what a

30
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,420
difference a year makes for Naz i'm

31
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,699
cadry remember that stretch last year at

32
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,949
the beginning one goal in 19 games just

33
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,479
snakebit now Jeff he's up to 20 goals

34
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,100
his shots finding the back of the net

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,049
yeah Glen he's really become a complete

36
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,880
player for the Toronto Maple Leafs he's

37
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,010
doing it at all ends of the rink all

38
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,840
different phases of the hockey game and

39
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,400
tonight soon as I give him props for

40
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,420
scoring in tight and not shooting from

41
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,790
outside the dots

42
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,560
he scores to wrist shot goals what a

43
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,090
season to have 20 in the bank right now

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,189
with a lot of hockey games left you know

45
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,259
the rest is just gravy glad there's no

46
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,850
reason why he can't get 3035 goals this

47
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,650
year for the Leafs meanwhile you don't

48
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,360
often see Johnny Hockey you get caught

49
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,369
with a body check but he took a licking

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,930
a couple of times this game the big one

51
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,030
of course Leo Komarov running him over

52
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,860
the flames wanted a head shot Bob how do

53
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,170
you think the league will review this

54
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,939
well my esteemed panel colleague here

55
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,159
Jeff O'Neill said right away as soon as

56
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,229
it happened that was a clean but violent

57
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,060
hit and I'd be very surprised if the

58
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,159
league saw it any other way than that it

59
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,689
was not late it was not a charge it was

60
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,610
not an elbow there was no launching

61
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,909
involved now was there contact to the

62
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,710
head absolutely there was but I believe

63
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,240
the league would say this is unavoidable

64
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,670
contact if they had a taller player and

65
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,950
a smaller player there was body on body

66
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,710
contact the head contact was incidental

67
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,510
and while it was a very violent hit and

68
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,800
look for a moment as it Johnny Gaudreau

69
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,990
might be under the hockey game and the

70
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,250
fact he came back was a real positive I

71
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,350
don't believe there would be any

72
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,910
supplementary discipline and as we

73
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:23,100
pointed out during the game no penalty

74
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:25,170
call on the place so the refs appear to

75
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,660
have gotten right and I suspect the

76
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:30,830
league will endorse that called non call

77
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,830
by the referees
