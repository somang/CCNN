1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,290
all right thank you Paul. Denise

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,090
Andreacchi is in for a more line today.

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,859
we like temperatures to go up it was a

4
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,540
decent start to the day. yeah it

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,220
certainly is and lots of sunshine to come.

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,330
but as you can see behind me, we have

7
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,800
some active weather just skirting the

8
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,750
Bruce Peninsula. Some range fall in

9
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,610
through parts of cottage country and

10
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,960
even we have a special weather statement

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,279
for Timmins. So parts of northeastern

12
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,810
Ontario getting into some freezing rain.

13
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,000
It's all about the high pressure for the

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,619
southern tier of the province and the

15
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:24,210
JTA. plus we're getting a beautiful

16
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,760
southwesterly flow of air gusty at times

17
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,039
as we can see anywhere from about 30 to

18
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,140
50 km/h on and off throughout the

19
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,210
morning in the afternoon. but it's coming

20
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,530
from the southwest. so it's drawing

21
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,600
temperatures way up. yesterday for the

22
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,969
GTA, we averaged about 3 to 4

23
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:40,620
degrees. currently we're sitting in those

24
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,270
high single digits across parts of the

25
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,010
Southwest. We are already at 9 degrees at

26
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,530
Hamilton, Niagara and Oakville. We do have

27
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,300
the risk of some active weather. as we

28
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,950
can see it is north of us now but it's

29
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,719
very slow moving so most of the day

30
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,550
today we will be basking in some

31
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,930
November sunshine in through the east a

32
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,219
little bit cooler but still well above

33
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,870
the seasonal average where we should be.

34
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,609
Pearson yesterday 3.5

35
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:00,930
degrees for an average high. we're

36
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,520
already sitting at 9. we should bump

37
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,769
up a couple more degrees in the next

38
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,390
couple of hours and a mix of Sun and

39
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:08,280
clouds will continue with that gusty air.

40
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,020
but why would you want to be indoor

41
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,700
shopping on a day like today? These are

42
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,689
the type of days you need to take

43
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:14,520
advantage of. Partly cloudy skies for

44
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,990
most of the day and we're starting off

45
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,310
with a pretty good weekend we'll talk

46
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,780
more about the weekend weather in your

47
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,400
long range forecast coming up a little

48
00:01:20,400 --> 00:00:00,000
later on, Ken.
